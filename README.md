# Work day Scheduler

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.

* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

## The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
